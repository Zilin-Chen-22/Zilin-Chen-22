Hi, I’m Zilin Chen.

I’m currently learning Mechanical Engineering in Tsinghua Univeristy, and an exchange student at University of Tonronto MIE until December 2024.

I have a interest on Robotics, and have some experiences about collaborative robots, as well as some basic knowledge for control theories.
